    title: "Profiling Aviation Emissions: Sector Footprint & CORSIA Framework",
    description: "This paper explores aviation's rising emissions and its role as a hard-to-abate sector. It outlines key propulsion constraints, explaining why electrification remains a major technical and regulatory challenge. The paper concludes with an overview of CORSIAâ€”the primary international framework guiding emissions management and offsets within the aviation sector.",
